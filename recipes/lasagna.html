    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. 
        You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, 
        but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage <em>and</em> lean ground beef.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Tomato products: </strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li> 
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
            <p></p>
            

        </ul>
