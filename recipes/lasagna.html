    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. 
        You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, 
        but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage <em>and</em> lean ground beef.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Tomato products: </strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li> 
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
            <p></p>
        </ul>
    <h2>Step-by-step</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        <p></p>
       </ol>
